      <h4>CHANGE CONTROL - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>CC</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The <span class="tiny-i">i</span>ntranet Change Control system is a change request logging system and slot booking system. It has an intranet-based client interface, which can be accessed by all employees, or other relevant parties. This front-end will display schedules of existing slot bookings, and allow for the application of new slot bookings to be submitted for approval and authorisation. The system does not only cater for IT oriented changes but also provides for slot booking for other services such as the painting of offices, large office move projects, corporate projects etc.

An electronic approval and authorisation function allows for team approval, final Senior Manager authorisation and predefined or flexible authorisation workflows.

The applications back-office allows for the resolution of change control conflicts, which will automatically be highlighted if the system detects any conflicts based on predetermined business rules.

A novel feature to the change control system is that the various iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re application can be made to automatically feed into the <span class="tiny-i">i</span>CC system for all transactions that take place within those applications e.g. an <span class="tiny-i">i</span>PS request for the service to move 100 PC's. The transaction will be evaluated automatically by way of a business rule filter, which will automatically assess the transactions business risk factor.

Based on the risk factor it will either be discarded from the iCC log if the risk is insignificant or logged for further actioning by the back-office iCC team so as to minimize the risk to the organization.</p>

      <h4>PROCUREMENT SYSTEM - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>PS</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The intranet Procurement System (<span class="tiny-i">i</span>PS) allows client employees to browse and select various products and services from multiple electronic catalogues via a single employee-centric portal, without having to leave their desks.

Electronic catalogues can easily be updated and maintained by the client and allows for filtering the view of products and services based on employee profiles e.g. laptops are offered to Head Office staff but not shown in the catalogues for Stores employees.

Bundled with <span class="tiny-i">i</span>PS is the <span class="tiny-i">i</span>POL application (<span class="tiny-i">i</span>ntranet Policy Manager) which will allow for the electronic "acceptance" by client employees of company policies presented to them at the point of purchase e.g. if an employee wants internet access they need to "accept" the company''s internet disclaimer policy document, which will be presented electronically with this purchase.

Built into iPS is electronic authorisation, providing various levels of security and control. In addition authentication for Senior Authorisers would be performed through biometric (fingerprint) technology.

The delivery process for the effecting of the employees order can be performed either by the clients internal departmental service provider or by outsourced on-site vendors via automated intranet workflow. Execution of employee orders by outsourced vendors who are off-site is made possible through electronic communication methods such as email or Microsoft Biztalk.</p>

      <h4>ASSET MANAGEMENT - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>AM</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The intranet Asset Management system is effectively a financial asset register, which is fully, integrated into the various iw<strong class="red">@</strong>reapplication suite asset tracking functions. More specifically these functions are: iPS asset tagging providing the tracking of an asset through its full asset life cycle, the iPM problem requests logged and costed against the tagged item and the iPS used stock module which records the assets final decommissioning. This will provide the client with the total cost of ownership for the asset from "cradle to grave".

The asset register functionality is to provide and track the financial aspects of such assets life cycle. The variables recorded against the asset are amongst others its characteristics, its location, current "ownership", its tag data for audit ability and its depreciation charges versus its tax charges, which could differ depending on the taxation laws. The financial asset register is central to and integrates with all the iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re applications e.g. <span class="tiny-i">i</span>R$ (intranet recovery system).</p>

      <h4>BUDGET GENERATORS - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>BUD</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The intranet Budget Generator system allows for the history of all transactions captured via the iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re application suite to be collated and summarised per cost center, per month so as to generate an initial budget template.

This pre-populated historical cost template can then be further manipulated through ''scenario planning tools''. The system will allow for integration into reference data sources for those costs that were not initiated through iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re systems, such as the HR costs of salaries, pensions etc.</p>

      <h4>CLIENT RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>CC</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->

      <p>The intranet Client Relationship Management tool is specifically designed and is proprietary to the transactions that are processed through the iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re application suite. It is essentially a reporting tool, which will give the user the ability to extract various types of data based on multiple criteria.
A typical use for this tool would be by the clients relationship managers who would want to extract data about a specific employee which whom they have an appointment. The data gathered could be about that individual's procurement, problems logged and their related financial matters. Alternatively the data required could be about these details regarding this employees department or cost centre.</p>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The intranet New Employee Package will allow a manager to request various products and services for a new employee who will be joining the client in the near future. This business-rule driven application will prompt the manager for certain data regarding the new employee and will offer various pre-defined products and services, such as intranet user id, parking, Desktop PC's, furniture requirements, access cards, uniforms etc that may be required by the new employee.

The main objective is to ensure that all the services are provided in an orderly co-ordinated manner so that the new employee can be productive from the first day. This application would prompt and allow for a "quick buy"of the necessary items for a new incumbent.

Currently iNEP is limited to and based on products and services offered across the iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re application suite. External on-line service options may however be integrated at a later date.

The Employee Exiting Package will do the inverse of the iNEP and will ensure that the employee returns all the clients assets and that the employees access and all other services, which have an attached internal monthly cost attached are cancelled. </p>

      <h4>VERIFICATION MODULE - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>VM</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The invoice Verification Module integrates iPS stock procurement with the asset management functionality of iAM. Every invoice captured is verified against its source purchase order, and any serious exception results in the invoice being flagged as in dispute. Less serious exceptions result in warnings to the capturer. These verification rules and the severity of the associated exception are fully customizable, and include checks for payment account validity, line quantities, unit value variance, line value variance, total value variance, stock items and asset existence. Additional costs, which may not be on the purchase order, such as shipping may also be included on the captured invoice, and these are then verified against the purchase order to ensure that the total variance is within predefined levels. Once again, any exception in this check results in a dispute.

While capturing the invoice, the user needs to indicate the precise item or items are being selected from those received on the purchase order when dealing with detailed stock items. Assets in particular require this selection to be made by the user. If the user fails to do so, an exception is generated and the invoice processing may not proceed until the user resolves the dispute.

All disputes need to be resolved before an invoice may be completed. These disputes may require information or documentation from the vendor, or the re-authorisation of the purchase order when one of the variance rules cause a dispute due to excessive increase in unit, line, or total value.

When the invoice is verified correctly, it may be completed and sent for approval. The selected approver may either approve or decline the invoice. Once an invoice is approved, its payment may be processed. </p>

      <h4>PROBLEM MANAGEMENT - <span class="tiny-i">i</span>PM</h4>

      <!-- END H1 HEADING -->
      <p>The intranet Problem Management (iPM) system allows all the client employees to log their problems, irrespective of its nature, via an intelligent intranet interface. The employee is assisted through the simple process by means of a wizard-like DHTML screens.

Upon submission, the problem request will be assessed automatically by the iw<strong class="red">@</strong>re system to determine whether it requires authorisation, and will then be routed accordingly.
The back-office problem management team will receive the logged problem request and will be able to notify the clients internal service providers to assist with resolving the problem, or they can generate a works order to outsourced vendors to action a particular problem on their behalf e.g. a branch outside your Head Office area requires their refrigeration system repaired urgently.

However the client's employees can always opt to resolve their own problems through an on-line, self-help knowledge base system attendant.

Were the employees to have a desktop PC issue they can also request on-line support where a relevant IT consultant may remotely access and control the employees machine and resolve the problem, across the intranet.

Various other intelligent agents may be programmed to perform specific functions, which will help the client to quickly and effectively resolve their employees problems irrespective of their location. </p>
